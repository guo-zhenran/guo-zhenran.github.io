Hi, welcome to my homepage!

My name is Zhenran Guo and I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in Economics at School of Economics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. My interests basically lie in the field of behavioral and experimental economics and micro theory.

This homepage serves to introduce me and my future research, and to display my notes. Explore the CV, Research, and Notes & Resources pages for details.
